Forks and Clones

Fork a repository on github and then clone the forked repository to the current directory.  Afterwards, create a new branch and open a pull request in the browser back to the forked repository.

Note, since no changes have been committed, the pull request can't be submitted. However once a commit has been pushed, the page can simply be refreshed.

Currently, a password must be put in.

Parameters are: Username, SSH Github Repo link, NewBranchName (Defaults to "Feature")
